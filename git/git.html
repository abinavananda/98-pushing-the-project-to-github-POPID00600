    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>How to create git account</b></h1>
    <p><h1>1. Creating an account</h1>
        To sign up for an account on GitHub.com, navigate to https://github.com/ and follow the prompts.
        
        To keep your GitHub account secure you should use a strong and unique password. For more information, see "Creating a strong password."
        <br>
        <h1>2. Choosing your GitHub product</h1>
        You can choose GitHub Free or GitHub Pro to get access to different features for your personal account. You can upgrade at any time if you are unsure at first which product you want.
        
        For more information on all of GitHub's plans, see "GitHubâ€™s plans."
        <br>
        
        <h1> 3. Verifying your email address</h1>
        To ensure you can use all the features in your GitHub plan, verify your email address after signing up for a new account. For more information, see "Verifying your email address."
        <br>
        
        <h1>4. Configuring two-factor authentication</h1>
        Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. We strongly urge you to configure 2FA for the safety of your account. For more information, see "About two-factor authentication."
        
        Optionally, after you have configured 2FA, add a passkey to your account to enable a secure, passwordless login. For more information, see "About passkeys" and "Managing your passkeys."
        <br>
        
        <h1>5. Viewing your GitHub profile and contribution graph</h1>
        Your GitHub profile tells people the story of your work through the repositories and gists you've pinned, the organization memberships you've chosen to publicize, the contributions you've made, and the projects you've created. For more information, see "About your profile" and "Viewing contributions on your profile."</p>
