    <h1 style="text-align: center;">How to push a project to git</h1>
    <p>
        <h2>1.Create a remote, empty folder/repository on Github.</h2><br>
        1.Login to your Github account.<br>
        2.At the top right of any Github page, you should see a '+' icon. Click that, then select 'New Repository'.
        <br>
        3.Give your repository a name--ideally the same name as your local project. If I'm building a travel application, its folder will be called 'travel-app' on my computer, and 'travel-app' will be the Github repository name as well.
        <br>
        4.Click 'Create Repository'. The next screen you see will be important, so don't close it.
        <br>
        <h2>2. Connect your local project folder to your empty folder/repository on Github.</h2><br>
        1.The screen you should be seeing now on Github is titled 'Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before'.
        <br>
        2.Copy the link in the input right beneath the title, it should look something like this: https://github.com/yourname/yourproject.git
        This is the web address that your local folder will use to push its contents to the remote folder on Github.
        <br>
        3.Go back to your project in the terminal/command line.
        <br>
        4.In your terminal/command line, type git remote add origin [copied web address] Example: git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/yourproject.git
        <br>
        5.Push your branch to Github: git push -u origin main
        <br>
        6. Go back to the folder/repository screen on Github that you just left, and refresh it. The title 'Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before' should disappear, and you should see your files there.
